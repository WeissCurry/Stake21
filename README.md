## 🧩 Problem It Solves

Stake21 solves the long-standing issue of **trust and accessibility in DeFi for Muslim investors**.  
Despite the **$3 trillion Islamic finance market**, no existing staking protocol offers verifiable **on-chain Sharia compliance**.

This gap has led to:
- **Regulatory and religious uncertainty**, especially in Indonesia and other Muslim-majority nations.  
  _“Crypto market is legal, but not halal yet.”_
- **Financial exclusion** of a massive potential user base due to lack of trust.

**Stake21** introduces a **Sharia-certified staking model** using the *Ijarah (rental)* contract, allowing users to:
- Participate in DeFi **ethically and safely**.  
- Earn **stable and halal returns** through a transparent and auditable mechanism.  
- Build **confidence in blockchain** without compromising religious principles.

## ⚙️ Challenges I Ran Into

Building a Sharia-compliant DeFi protocol came with both **technical and philosophical** challenges.

**Key Hurdles**
- **Modeling the Ijarah contract on-chain** – Translating rental-based profit-sharing logic into smart contracts required custom structures for Ujrah (rental fees) and validation rights.  
- **Balancing decentralization with compliance** – Smart contracts had to allow external Sharia audits **without breaking trustlessness**.  
- **Designing transparent on-chain audit verification** – Ensuring audit data is readable, verifiable, and stored securely on Flow.

**How We Overcame Them**
- Consulted with **Islamic finance experts** and referenced **MUI Fatwa No.7/2021**.  
- Built a **modular architecture** (Next.js + Wagmi + Cadence) separating staking logic, audits, and reporting.  
- Leveraged **Flow’s resource-oriented model** to ensure secure and auditable transaction flows.
